## Java Ray Tracer
A simple, CPU-based ray tracer built in Java by porting Peter Shirley's 
"Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book series. This project is a personal 
exploration into the fundamentals of computer graphics and rendering
algorithms, now adapted for the Java language.

### About This Project
This program generates photorealistic images by simulating the path of
light rays as they interact with objects in a 3D scene. The implementation
is based on the concepts from the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series,
but all code is written in Java, highlighting differences in language 
features, memory management, and object-oriented design.
